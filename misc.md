1. I was an avid quizzer, and have taken part in, and hosted, quite a few intercollegiate quizzes in my undergraduate days. At IISc, I have twice co-hosted the general quizzes as part of the Open Day celebrations at the ECE department.
2. In a much earlier avatar, I was a part of the [Indian Schools Debating Society](https://indianschoolsdebatingsociety.com/). The tournaments then involved, almost exclusively, schools in Chennai, but the organization has now expanded greatly to include schools from all over India. The debates followed the format of the [World Schools Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Schools_Style_debate).
3. Several of my art works (acrylic on canvas, primarily) have been on display in art exhibitions held at the Lalit Kala Akademi (National Academy of Art), Chennai.
