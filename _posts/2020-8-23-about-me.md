I am an Assistant Professor at [IIT Madras](iitm.ac.in), in the Department of [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/).

I have a PhD degree from the [Department of Electrical Communication Engineering](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/) of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. Earlier, I received the B.E. (Hons.) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from BITS, Pilani--Hyderabad Campus, in 2018, graduating with a gold medal. Post my PhD, I spent some time at [India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX)](https://iudx.org.in/), a non-profit initiative of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Govt. of India, where I worked on differential privacy.

My current research interests are broadly in the fields of information theory and error-control coding, and in data privacy. My Ph.D. thesis was recently awarded the Seshagiri Kaikini Medal for the year 2023--24, for the best Ph.D. thesis from the ECE Department at IISc. A part of my work towards my Ph.D. thesis was awarded the [IEEE Jack Keil Wolf ISIT Student Paper Award](https://www.itsoc.org/honors/wolf-award#:~:text=The%20IEEE%20Jack%20Keil%20Wolf,the%20principal%20author%20and%20presenter.) at the ISIT 2023. 

My research has received generous support from [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowships (QIF) India](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship) 2020, 2022, and 2023, and from a Prime Minister's Research Fellowship (PMRF) 2020.
